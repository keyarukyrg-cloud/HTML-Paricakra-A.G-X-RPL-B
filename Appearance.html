<p>Frank Morrison wears a gray hoodie under a black leather jacket, camouflage pants, a mask with a grinning smiley face drawn on and a couple of bloodstains, and bloodstained bandages wrapped around his hands, and gray shoes. Frank's weapon of choice is a hunting knife.</p>

<p>Julie Kostenko wears a similar outfit to Frank with a gray hoodie under a black leather jacket, but she wears tan pants and bloodsoaked bandages around her hands and gray shoes, and her mask, although similar in appearance to Frank's, has bloody finger markings on it. Like Frank Julie's weapon of choice is a survival knife.</p>

<p>Susie Lavoie wears usually a teal hoodie with a red plaid skirt with black leggings, green sneakers, a black choker with a silver buckle, and a mask that appears to have stitching on it with her pink hair poking out from under the mask. Susie's weapon of choice is a ruler sharpened into a stake with duct tape wrapped around it.</p>

<p>Joey Cadogan wears a black and white hoodie, a black sling bag with pins around on his back with the strap around his right shoulder, bloodsoaked black gloves with whiteish strays, gray pants, black and light brown shoes and a bloodstained black and white Paisley balaclava-like skull mask with black facepaint around his eyes. Joey's weapon of choice is a karambit with a custom, more comfortable grip.</p><hr>
