<p>The Legion are a close-knit group of murderous Killers, linked by the desire to dole out pain in equal measure. Keep the injuries coming with Feral Frenzy, a high-intensity sprint that can set off a devastating chain reaction. Survivors will be constantly tending to their wounds, leaving them vulnerable to be picked off one by one.</p>
<p>The Legion are a band of merciless Killers, able to rushdown helpless Survivors with their power, Feral Frenzy. Attacks made during their frenzy inflict lingering internal damage, downing any Survivors that are not quick enough to react.</p>

<p>Personal Perks, Discordance</p>

, Mad Grit

, and Iron Maiden

, give them the ability to locate their prey and attack savagely while transporting Survivors to the hook.
