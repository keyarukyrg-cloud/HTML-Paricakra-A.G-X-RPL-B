<p>Thanatophobia is a perk in Dead by Daylight that slows down survivor actions when other survivors are injured, dying, or hooked.<br> It inflicts a stackable 1%/1.5%/2% penalty to repairing,sabotaging, and cleansing actions for each affected survivor,<br> up to a maximum of 4%/6%/8%. If all four survivors are affected, an additional 12% penalty is applied for a total of 16%/18%/20%.<br><br><b>! THIS PERKS WAS AN "THE NURSE" SIGNATURE PERKS !</b>

<p>Corrupt Intervention is a killer perk that blocks the three generators furthest from the<br> killer at the start of a trial. It deactivates prematurely once the first survivor is put into the dying state, but it provides an advantage<br>by forcing survivors to move towards the killer's spawn to find and repair generators.<br><br><b>!

<p>Scourge Hooks are special hooks that transform a few randomly selected hooks in a trial to have a unique effect, triggered by either hooking<br> a survivor on them or unhooking them from them. The specific effect depends on the killer's equipped Scourge Hook perk, <br>such as making the injured survivor's healing speed slower with Gift of Pain, or causing generators to explode with Pain Resonance.</p>

<p>iscordance is a killer perk in Dead by Daylight that highlights any generator being repaired by two or more survivors within a specific range,<br> and triggers a loud noise notification when the generator is first highlighted. The highlighted yellow aura lingers for 4 seconds after <br>the generator is no longer being worked on by multiple survivors or is out of range. </p>
